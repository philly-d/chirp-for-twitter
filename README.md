# Chirp for Twitter

[Chirp for Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chirp-for-twitter/mlocpcjojbacdcajmjmlfonfibnleede) is a chrome extension that lets you screenshot and tweet articles in one click, and when you open a link from Twitter.com, Chirp shows the corresponding Twitter conversation on the page, so you can easily join the conversation with more context. So far, it's a hacked-together side-project, but it'll hopefully see lots of improvements in the future.

Chirp is developed with @schovi's awesome [webpack-chrome-extension](https://github.com/schovi/webpack-chrome-extension).
